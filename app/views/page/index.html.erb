        <p>The Department of Transportation and Communication and the Ateneo de Manila University have collaborated to create this Open Transportation Portal as part of the Open Data Initiatives of the Philippine Government.</p>
        
        <p>As one of the eight founding states of the Open Government Partnership, the Philippine government is committed to <b>open governance through initiatives that make national government data searchable, accessible, and useful</b>, with the help of the different agencies of government, and with the participation of the public. </p>

        <h2>What will I find here?</h2>
        
        <p>This website consolidates the datasets of the Department of Transportation and Communication and its attached agencies, allowing users to find specific information from a <b>rich and continuously growing collection of public datasets on air, maritime, rail and road infrastructure projects</b>.</p>
        
        <p>It also provides information on how to access these datasets and tools, such as infographics and applications developed by the Ateneo de Manila University and other groups, to make the information easy to understand. </p>

        <h2>How can I help?</h2>
        
        <p>Users may not only view the datasets, but also share and download them as spreadsheets and other formats, for their own use. The Department of Transportation and Communication encourages the public to <b>request for the data they want, send in comments, suggestions, and even stories of how they use open data</b>. Likewise, it also encourages the public to participate by submitting new information, applications and visualizations based on the public data.</p>
        
        <p>This engagement of ideas between the public and the government will help develop the platform even further, for the benefit of everyone involved. <b>The primary goal of Open Data is to foster a citizenry empowered to make informed decisions, and to promote efficiency and transparency in government.</b></p>
